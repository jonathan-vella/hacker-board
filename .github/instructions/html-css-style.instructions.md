# HTML CSS Style Color Guide

Follow these guidelines when creating or updating HTML/CSS styles.

## 60-30-10 Color Rule

- **Primary Color (60%)**: Cool or light color (backgrounds, large surfaces)
- **Secondary Color (30%)**: Cool or light color (cards, sections, navigation)
- **Accent (10%)**: Complementary hot color (buttons, CTAs, highlights)

## Background Colors

**Never use:** Purple, magenta, red, orange, yellow, pink, or any hot color for backgrounds.

**Recommended:** White/off-white, light cool colors (light blues, light greens), subtle neutral tones.

## Text Colors

**Never use:** Yellow (poor contrast), pink, light text on light backgrounds, dark text on dark backgrounds.

**Recommended:**
- Dark neutrals: #1f2328, #24292f (on light backgrounds)
- Near-black: #000000 to #333333
- Dark grays: #4d4d4d, #6c757d
- Near-white: #ffffff to #f0f2f3 (on dark backgrounds)
- Always ensure high-contrast combinations for accessibility (4.5:1 minimum)

## Colors to Use Sparingly

Hot colors (red, orange, yellow):
- Reserve for critical alerts, warnings, or error messages
- Use only to convey urgency or importance
- Limit to small accent areas, not large sections

## Gradients

- Keep color shifts minimal (e.g., #E6F2FF to #F5F7FA)
- Stay within the same color family
- Avoid combining hot and cool colors in a single gradient
- Prefer linear gradients over radial for backgrounds
