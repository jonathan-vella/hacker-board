# Step 2: Architecture Assessment — HackerBoard

![Step](https://img.shields.io/badge/Step-2-blue)
![Status](<https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Superseded%20(Phase%2018)-orange>)
![Agent](https://img.shields.io/badge/Agent-Architect-purple)

> [!WARNING]
> **Partially superseded by Phase 18 (App Service Migration).** The SWA managed identity sidecar `expires_on` bug made Cosmos DB MI authentication unreliable. Decisions D28/D29/D30 replaced SWA with App Service for Linux Containers + ACR. The WAF pillar analysis, Cosmos DB RBAC decision, and governance compliance remain valid. Compute architecture, cost estimates, and SKU recommendations are superseded — see [04-implementation-plan.md](04-implementation-plan.md) for the current architecture.
>
> **Key changes**: SWA Standard ($9/mo) → App Service B1 Linux (~$13.14/mo) + ACR Basic (~$5/mo); managed Functions → Express adapter; SWA built-in auth → App Service Easy Auth; region: `westeurope` → `centralus`.

## Executive Summary

> [!NOTE]
> **Updated for Phase 18**: The original architecture used Azure Static Web Apps. The current architecture uses **App Service for Linux Containers + ACR + Express adapter**. See [04-implementation-plan.md](04-implementation-plan.md).

HackerBoard is an event-driven hackathon scoring dashboard with a low user count (≤50 concurrent), short data lifecycle (event + 30 days), and a strong cost-minimization mandate. The workload pattern is: a containerized Node.js API (Express 5.x) served via Azure App Service for Linux Containers, with static frontend assets served by the same Express process, and persistence via Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL (Serverless). Docker images are stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR Basic) and pulled by the App Service via managed identity (`acrPull` role).

The primary architectural trade-off is **cost optimization vs. reliability**: the single-region deployment and absence of private networking are deliberate cost decisions acceptable for an internal, short-lived event tool. Security is compensated by Entra ID RBAC-only access to Cosmos DB (local auth auto-disabled by governance), managed identity authentication, and GitHub OAuth configured via App Service Easy Auth.

**Estimated monthly cost: ~$18.15** — App Service B1 (~$13.14) + ACR Basic (~$5.00) + Cosmos DB Serverless (~$0.01). Still well below the $50/day ($1,500/month) budget ceiling.

### 🔒 Security Assessment (8/10)

**Strengths:**

- Managed identity (`DefaultAzureCredential`) eliminates all connection strings and secrets
- Cosmos DB local auth auto-disabled by governance policy (`ModifyCosmosDBLocalAuth`) — API can only authenticate via Entra ID RBAC
- Dual authentication: GitHub OAuth for team members, Entra ID for admins — both managed by SWA built-in auth (`.auth/` endpoints)
- MFA enforced on all resource write operations by governance policy `sys.mfa-write` (Deny effect)
- TLS 1.2 minimum enforced on all platform services (`minimalTlsVersion: Tls12`)
- Platform-managed encryption at rest for Cosmos DB
- App Insights connection string (not key) used — connection strings are post-breach revocable
- No Key Vault required — zero secrets to store or rotate

**Gaps:**

- Public endpoints accepted for both SWA and Cosmos DB (private endpoints disabled for cost optimization)
- No Azure DDoS Protection Standard (not warranted for internal event tool)
- No WAF (Azure Front Door / App Gateway) in front of SWA — authenticated-only routes mitigate this
- Content Security Policy (CSP) must be explicitly configured in `staticwebapp.config.json`

**Recommendations:**

1. Configure CSP, HSTS, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `X-Frame-Options` response headers in `staticwebapp.config.json` — this is the primary remaining security hardening action
2. Ensure `requireAuthentication: true` is set for all API routes in `staticwebapp.config.json` to deny-by-default all unauthenticated access
3. Review F11 (anonymized attendee aliases) before any future expansion to confirm PII scope remains minimal

---

### 🔄 Reliability Assessment (7/10)

**Strengths:**

- Azure Static Web Apps Standard is globally distributed (multi-region CDN) by design — static asset availability exceeds 99.9%
- Cosmos DB Serverless provides continuous backup with 7-day point-in-time restore (PITR) — RPO of 1 hour is met
- Serverless billing model means no resource starvation during traffic spikes at hackathon scale (≤50 users)
- RTO 4 hours is achievable via `deploy.ps1` or "Deploy to Azure" button re-provisioning from Bicep templates in Git
- Cosmos DB single-partition reads are consistently sub-10ms at this data volume

**Gaps:**

- Single-region deployment (`centralus` only) — regional outage = full outage with no automatic failover
- No Azure Monitor alert rules configured — issues detected reactively via manual App Insights review
- Managed Functions (SWA-hosted) may experience cold starts of 1–3 seconds after periods of inactivity between hackathon events
- Cosmos DB Serverless does not support `enableAutomaticFailover` or Availability Zones

**Recommendations:**

1. Accept single-region as an explicit risk for this event-based, non-production workload — document in the Risk Register
2. Add at minimum one Azure Monitor alert rule for Cosmos DB 5xx errors and SWA function failure rate to enable proactive detection during live events
3. Configure a keep-warm ping (e.g., scheduled GitHub Actions workflow calling `/api/health`) to reduce cold starts before event start

---

### ⚡ Performance Assessment (7/10)

**Strengths:**

- SWA CDN delivers static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) from edge PoPs — `<2,000 ms` page load target easily met for EU users
- Cosmos DB NoSQL Serverless returns results in single-digit milliseconds for point reads; partition key design (`/teamId` for scores/submissions, `/id` for teams/rubrics) enables efficient targeted queries
- 50 concurrent user target is well within managed Functions auto-scale capacity
- Application Insights client-side SDK provides real user monitoring (RUM) for page load and API latency visibility

**Gaps:**

- Cold start latency on managed Functions (Node.js 20+) can reach 1–3 seconds after inactivity — the `<500 ms p95 API` target may be missed on the first request after idle periods
- Cross-container queries (e.g., joining scores with team names) require multiple round-trips — API must join in application code
- No query result caching layer (e.g., Redis) — acceptable at this scale but noted for future growth

**Recommendations:**

1. Implement a `/api/health` warm-up endpoint and invoke it before each hackathon event to pre-initialize the Functions worker
2. Design Cosmos DB queries to use the partition key on every query — avoid cross-partition fan-out; denormalize where needed (e.g., embed team name in score documents)
3. Set `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1` and ensure Functions are bundled minimally to reduce cold start initialization time

**Cost Optimization Applied:**

- Cosmos DB Serverless selected over Provisioned Throughput — eliminates idle RU cost between hackathon events (potentially weeks of zero usage)
- SWA Standard flat-rate includes managed Functions — no separate Function App or App Service Plan required
- Log Analytics and App Insights both operate within their 5 GB/month free tier at this workload scale
- Private endpoints explicitly disabled — saves ~$7–10/month per endpoint
- No VNet, no NAT Gateway, no Front Door — eliminates the largest potential cost drivers for this workload type

---

### 🔧 Operational Excellence Assessment (7/10)

**Strengths:**

- Infrastructure as Code: all 15 resources defined in Bicep (AVM modules) — repeatable, auditable provisioning
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflow deploys on push to `main`; conventional commits enforced
- Automated admin setup: Entra ID app registration + admin role assignment via deployment script in Bicep — no manual portal steps
- App Insights + Log Analytics configured in Bicep — observability from day one
- Cleanup script (`scripts/cleanup-app-data.js`) supports GDPR right-to-erasure and event reset
- Seed data script (`scripts/seed-demo-data.js`) supports rapid event setup

**Gaps:**

- No Azure Monitor alert rules configured — operational issues during live events will be detected reactively
- No automated cost alert / budget threshold notification
- No tag-based cost allocation reporting configured (tags are set on resources; cost query not automated)
- Incident runbook for event-day failures not documented

**Recommendations:**

1. Add an Azure Monitor alert rule for Cosmos DB `TotalRequestUnits` anomaly and HTTP 5xx errors before the first live event
2. Configure an Azure Cost Management budget alert at 80% of the $50/day ceiling
3. Document a one-page event-day runbook covering: warm-up checklist, key monitoring queries, and recovery steps
